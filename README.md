# monster-brawl
 2 Players use three doors to escape from the wild jungle.
 They must release their powerful monsters to hit the barrel and get damaged from the explode barrel to open their doors. The more powerful damage can unlock the door. After the explosion, the poison under the ground leaks to this lane. If any monsters are released to this lane, they will die immediately.
